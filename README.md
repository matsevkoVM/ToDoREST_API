This is an educational application which can create Users and ToDo Lists for them and Tasks inside of ToDo Lists.
I used Spring Boot to develop it, PostgreSQL to store data and Spring Sequrity to authorize and authenticate users.


There are three predefined users in the DB with roles ADMIN and USER.

| Login         | Password | Role  |
|---------------|:--------:|:-----:|
| mike@mail.com |   1111   | ADMIN |
| nick@mail.com |   2222   | USER  |
| nora@mail.com |   3333   | USER  |
